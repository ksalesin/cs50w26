        <h1>Activity: Bit Packing &amp; Masking</h1>
<p>Copy the file <code>rgb.c</code> from our examples directory into your home directory on plink.</p>
<p>Turn in your group's completed <code>rgb.c</code> to Canvas for this activity.</p>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>As you may know, it is common to digitally represent a color using RGB format for its Red, Green, and Blue components. Each channel is typically represented with a single integer from 0 to 255. The RGB value can also be combined into a single hex code: for example, a pure red color with RGB values (255, 0, 0) could also be represented with the hex code 0xFF0000, a pure green (0, 255, 0) would be 0x00FF00, and a pure blue (0, 0, 255) would be 0x0000FF.</p>
<p>While we could represent a color using a struct that holds three separate integers for Red, Green, and Blue, this would be a waste of space since we can assume that each value will always be in [0, 255]. Instead, we will use a <em>single</em> integer to contain all three RGB values (which is often done in practice). This is called <strong>bit packing</strong>: storing multiple pieces of information in a single variable by segmenting its bits into chunks.</p>
<p>Fill in <code>rgb.c</code> such that you can set and get each component of an RGB color stored in a single integer variable.</p>
<p>For the 3 <code>set</code> functions, remember to practice <em>defensive programming</em> – verify that the input value is in [0, 255]. If it is not, print an error message and <code>exit(1)</code>.</p>
<p>As always, test your functions as you write them!</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: how many bits do you need to represent the full range [0, 255]?</p>
<p><strong>Hint #2</strong>: aside from printing and input validation, all of the functions should be simple one-liners involving <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Hint #3</strong>: you will likely want to utilize <strong>bit masks</strong> that resemble the hex codes above.</p>
