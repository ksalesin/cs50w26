        <h1>Groups and pipelines</h1>
<p>Create a markdown (.md) file to record your group's responses to the questions below -- one of you will submit this summary on Canvas at the end of class. Put the names of your group mates at the top of the file.</p>
<h2>Billboard Hot 100</h2>
<p>Let's play with the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100">Billboard Hot 100</a>, which I extracted into a text file <a href="/~ksalesin/cs50/activities/activity1/billboard.tsv"><code>billboard.tsv</code></a> in 2021.
(<code>tsv</code> stands for <em>tab-separated values</em>).
You can copy this file directly on plink into your current working directory to make this a little easier:</p>
<pre><code>cp /home/cs50/shared/examples/billboard.tsv .
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>less</code> to display the first 10 lines of the file. It begins with a title line followed by a separator line.
The next 100 lines are in the form:</p>
<pre><code>#\tSong title\tArtist
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>'#' is a number between 1 and 100, inclusive</li>
<li>'\t' is a single tab character</li>
<li>'Song title' is a string, possibly including blanks, which is the song title</li>
<li>'\t' is a single tab character</li>
<li>'Artist' is a string representing a list of one or more artists who made the recording. Here, &quot;artist&quot; refers to the
full string of names; don't worry about picking apart lists of names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, <strong>working in your group (perhaps one person sharing screen)</strong>, write pipelines to accomplish the following. Add your group answers to a markdown file (<code>activity1.md</code>) and upload it to Canvas for this activity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Print the list to the screen without the header lines</li>
<li>Sort the list to start at 100 and countdown to 1</li>
<li>Print only the list of artists to the screen</li>
<li>How many times does &quot;Justin&quot; appear?</li>
<li>How many artists are in the top 100?</li>
<li>Which artist had the most hits in top 100?</li>
<li>Print only the list of titles to the screen</li>
<li>What's the most common word in a title? (much trickier)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some useful commands: <code>cut</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>wc</code></p>
<p>Remember you can use <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> to see what each of these commands does and its options.</p>
<p><strong>Don't forget to upload your answers to Activity 1 on Canvas! Only one of you needs to upload.</strong></p>
<h2>If you finish early, here's a challenge:</h2>
<p>Given two files <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, create a two command pipeline (i.e., only one <code>|</code> symbol) between
two Bash commands (not <code>awk</code>) and redirect their output to an output file <code>c</code> such that ...</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>c is a union b</li>
<li>c is a intersect b</li>
</ol>

## Where did I get that file? 

I used this great [open-source package](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts);
on my Mac, I followed its instructions to install the package, then

```bash
$ python3
Python 3.9.2 (default, Feb 24 2021, 13:30:36) 
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> import billboard
>>> sys.stdout = open('billboard.txt','w')
>>> chart = billboard.ChartData('hot-100')
>>> print(chart)
>>> ^D
$ sed -e "s/\. '/\t/" -e "s/' by /\t/" billboard.txt > billboard.tsv
```

That last line uses `sed` to convert the "dot space quote" into a tab, and the "quote space by space" into a tab.
The result is a three-column file (with a two-line header), which should be easier to parse.
