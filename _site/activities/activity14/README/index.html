<h1>Can you break it?</h1>
<p>Put your team's answers in a Markdown file and upload it to Canvas for Activity 14.</p>
<h2>or, <em>If it's worth doing, it's worth testing.</em></h2>
<p>For this activity we will discuss testing plans.</p>
<p>In the following scenarios, you and your team should discuss appropriate testing
plans. The tests should be automatable, such as via a <code>Makefile</code> or test program
or shell script.</p>
<h2>What to test ?</h2>
<p>Consider these aspects of the software being tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>what the software is expected to do</li>
<li>what are the inputs (types, ranges, valid/invalid inputs, edge cases, etc.)</li>
<li>what are the expected outputs (types, ranges, valid/invalid inputs, etc.);
in particular, are there any outputs with unintended side-effects</li>
<li>are the expected users novices, experienced users, or both</li>
<li>are there needed tests to verify the code doesn't do what it shouldn't do</li>
<li>are there any &quot;fail safe&quot; situations that need testing? (may not be automatable)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<ol>
<li>Software to operate a bluetooth-enabled home door-lock operated by a phone.</li>
<li>A drone-based coffee delivery service.</li>
<li>An app to control access to personal health information stored on a phone.</li>
<li>Software to operate a robotic lawn mower.</li>
<li>Autograding software for COSC 50 lab assignments.</li>
</ol>
