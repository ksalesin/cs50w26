        <h1>Activity 20 - Scrum project management</h1>
<h2>The &quot;Project&quot; for this activity</h2>
<p>Your team has received a request from the small volcanic island nation of Clang for a proposal to have the <em>exclusive</em> right to build a vacation resort there (it <em>is</em> a small island). The submission for this large contract is a brochure that describes your unique approach to a vacation resort.</p>
<p>The &quot;project&quot; is to come up with the resort idea and to build a brochure for it. The 1-page brochure should describe the resort's amenities, should be aimed at the desired set of clients (families, singles, retirees, gourmands, professors, bureaucrats, volcanologists, distillers, Swifties, zookeepers, etc.), and be attractive and interesting.</p>
<h2>Scrum Setup</h2>
<h3>Step 1 - define tasks</h3>
<p>Make up a detailed list of tasks that you need to accomplish to complete the brochure. For example, these might include selecting your unique resort idea, resort activities, pricing goals (luxury, rustic, all-inclusive, ...), pictures needed, prose needed, special equipment needed, and accommodations style, among others. The tasks may be workable in parallel or might need to be serialized (one depends upon another). Aim for 30 tasks for the activity.</p>
<h3>Step 2 - build sprints</h3>
<p>Determine a rough sequence for accomplishing the tasks, and then group them into <em>Sprints</em>. Each Sprint should include tasks that can be worked on in parallel. Define the acceptance criteria (definition of ‘done’) for each task in order to clarify requirements and to identify sub-tasks. If sprint <em>Y</em> depends on one or more tasks from sprint <em>T</em>, then <em>Y</em> will need to come somewhere after <em>T</em>.</p>
<h3>Step 3 - define &quot;done&quot;</h3>
<p>For each sprint, define the acceptance criteria (definition of ‘done’) for each task in order to clarify requirements and to identify sub-tasks. This can include whether one person's task needs approval from the others. Any discovered sub-tasks should be noted in the sprint.</p>

</div>
<p>Put your team's answers in a Markdown file and upload it to Canvas for Activity 20.</p>
<h2>IF YOU HAVE TIME ...</h2>
<h3>Step 4 - Build the brochure!</h3>
<p>Sprints are tackled in order. Team members sign up for tasks and do them. For this activity, have Sprints of 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
<p>When a Sprint ends, the members share their results (good or bad) with the team. If someone couldn't finish their task, they will finish it followed by other tasks on the next sprint.</p>
<p>Produce a mock-up of your brochure as a jpg/png/gif and post it to the <code>#random</code> channel of our Slack workspace.</p>
