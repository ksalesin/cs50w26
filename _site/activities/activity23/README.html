        <h1>Activity: Git with the Flow [^1]</h1>
<p>Practice setting up and running a team project using Git-Flow on GitHub.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><img src="media/gg.jpeg" alt="greengoblinmascot"></p>
<p>Each member of the team is chair of a different department at Green State University (<em>&quot;Go Goblins!&quot;</em>). Your goal is to produce a course listing for the upcoming Summer session.  The usual courses aren't offered then, so your job is to come up with some new courses your department will offer.</p>
<p>Each course listing must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 character department code &amp; course number (000-999)</li>
<li>title (up to 30 chars)</li>
<li>description (up to 80 chars)</li>
</ul>
<p>The courses should be listed in course # order under the department heading in the <a href="./catalog.md"><code>catalog.md</code></a> file. Each word of the course title should be capitalized, except for words with fewer than 4 characters. The description should be formatted as normal English sentences.</p>
<p>The courses are listed in the associated department files (e.g., <code>math.md</code>) which are hyperlink'ed from the <code>catalog.md</code> file.</p>
<p>For example, in the English department you might offer:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ENGL007</strong> <em>Poetry of Ian Fleming</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Study of verse from the spy master.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ENGL042</strong> <em>Don't Panic People!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Societal commentaries of Douglas Adams.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Note: you can produce this layout using the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">---
**ENGL007** _Poetry of Ian Fleming_
&gt; Study of verse from the spy master.  
**ENGL042** _Don't Panic People!_
&gt; Social commentaries of Douglas Adams.  
---
</code></pre>
<p>Humor is encouraged, but keep it clean.</p>
<p>When finished, the <code>main</code> branch of your repository will contain a complete markdown version of the Summer session catalog.</p>
<p>You are provided a primary markdown file, <a href="./catalog.md"><code>catalog.md</code></a>, to which you will add links to each of the departments' markdown files.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the only activity where we <strong>don't</strong> want you to talk <strong>directly</strong> to other members of your team.  Instead, use Slack for all communications between members of the team, like a remote programming team!  Each team has a private Slack channel for this activity and the upcoming project.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One team member is chosen as the &quot;Project Lead&quot; who then accepts the <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/ij-rLfGK">activity assignment</a> from GitHub Classroom as usual.</p>
<p>a. go to the new repository <strong>on GitHub</strong><br>
b. make sure the new repo is private.<br>
c. set GitHub to <a href="https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/home/blob/main/knowledge/units/protect-main.md">protect the main branch</a>.<br>
d. invite other team members to join the repo with the  <code>maintain</code> role:</p>
<pre><code>Settings -&gt; Collaborators and teams-&gt;...  
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team decides which member will handle which department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each team member does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repo from your Project Leader on GitHub and <code>cd</code> into the cloned repo.</li>
<li>Create a local feature branch for your work, with a name indicating the department you are handling, e.g., <code>math-department</code>.</li>
<li>Switch to that new feature branch.</li>
<li>Add at least 4 classes to the corresponding <code>.md</code> file (e.g., <code>math.md</code>).</li>
<li>Edit the <code>catalog.md</code> file to add your username in the department chair slot of the department you selected.</li>
<li>Push your branch to GitHub.
<code>git push -u origin branch-name</code></li>
<li>Preview your branch on GitHub. Is content correct? Does the formatting meet the requirements? Are any words spelled incorrectly?</li>
<li>If everything is correct, open a Pull Request for your branch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respond to Pull Requests (everyone).</p>
<ul>
<li>When you see a Pull Request from a team member, review their
branch on GitHub.</li>
<li>Comment on their Pull Request.
<ul>
<li>Formatting or spelling problems? Are prices consistent?</li>
<li>Items in alphabetical order?</li>
<li>Do you approve the merge into main?  If so, then do it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge &amp; Close Pull Request (feature author).</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to comments to your Pull Request. If problems, fix them
&amp; push again.</li>
<li>After your team <em>approves your work</em>, merge your branch into <code>main</code>.</li>
<li>If GitHub cannot do an automatic merge, it probably means that <code>main</code> has changed since you cloned it. In that case do the following:
<ol>
<li><code>git fetch</code> main from GitHub to your local repo and merge into your local <code>main</code>.</li>
<li>Merge your feature branch into main on your machine. Fix any conflicts, and if you repair any conflicts you need to commit again afterwards.</li>
<li>Push your (merged) main to GitHub. This time it should succeed. If you made any changes to your feature branch, push those, too.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><em><strong>Create a markdown file containing the URL of your github repository used for this activity. Then upload that file to Canvas for Activity 23.</strong></em></h2>
