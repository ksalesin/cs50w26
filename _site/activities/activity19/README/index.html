<h1>Activity - Intersect 'em !</h1>
<p>With your group,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Review <a href="https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/examples/blob/main/set_iterate2.c">set_iterate2</a>.
(Note also <a href="https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/examples/blob/main/set_iterate.makefile">set_iterate.makefile</a>.)
It shows how to construct the <em>union</em> of two sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss how you would construct the <em>intersection</em> of two sets - it's analogous, but harder than it looks!
(I found that the <code>itemfunc</code> needed a pointer to each set, not just the one set, as in the example above.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[If you have time,] Create a <code>set_iterate3.c</code> by modifying <a href="https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/examples/blob/main/set_iterate2.c">set_iterate2</a>, and add the intersection functionality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll need this technique for Lab 6!</p>
<p>Put your team's answers in a Markdown file and upload it to Canvas for Activity 19.</p>
