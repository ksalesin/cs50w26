<h3>Positive Practices</h3>
<p>Discuss and record practices, processes, or tools that had positive impacts on team interaction and productivity. Some examples are listed below. <em>Replace these instructions and examples with your own list of positive practices.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mandated daily progress reports helped keep each other on task and resolve misunderstandings promptly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Practices</h3>
<p>Discuss and record practices, processes, or tools that had negative impacts on team interaction and productivity. Some examples are listed below. <em>Replace these instructions and examples with your own list of negative practices.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We did not meet or communicate outside of our mandated Scrum meetings, which increased the time it took to identify and resolve issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>Based on your responses to the first two prompts, how do you (as a team) plan on improving yourselves during the next Sprint? Try not to put something generic such as &quot;we will communicate better&quot;. Instead, provide the specific actions required by the team to improve. Some examples are listed below. <em>Replace these instructions and examples with your own list of actions.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We found that our communication was lacking, so we plan to hold extra meetings on days x,y,z.</li>
<li>We found that the scope for some of our Sprint Backlog items were too large, so we are breaking them into more manageable chunks.</li>
</ul>
