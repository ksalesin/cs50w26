<h2><a id="linux">Linux systems</a></h2>
<p>You will do all your programming and lab submission on Linux servers at Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.</p>
<!-- @CHANGEME - insert term-specific repo link -->
<p>To set yourself up, follow these <a href="https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA2025/cs50-dev">instructions</a>.</p>
<p>The primary CS50 server is called <code>plink.thayer.dartmouth.edu</code>; you may also use equivalent servers called <code>babylonX.thayer.dartmouth.edu</code>, where <code>X</code> is 1 through 8.
(You can check their status <a href="https://cluster-usage.thayer.dartmouth.edu">here</a>.)
Your laptop must first be on the campus network, or on <a href="https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=13404">Dartmouth VPN</a>, to access these servers.</p>
<p><strong>In CS50 we support development only on Thayer's Linux systems.</strong>
Not MacOS, not Windows, not even other Linux systems.
Linux systems differ in subtle ways; MacOS is a form of Unix different from Linux, and Windows is even more different.
<strong>Our graders will use <code>plink</code> for all testing</strong>.</p>
<h3>Tips for speedier login</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are a Mac or Linux user, you can reduce typing by adding the following to your laptop's <code>.ssh/config</code> file (using your own NetID); then you can type <code>ssh cs50</code> and only have to enter your password to login.</p>
<pre><code>Host cs50
   Hostname plink.thayer.dartmouth.edu
   User f12345x
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On MacOS, this file is <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, and you can create or append to it by opening that file in your favorite editor, or as follows (use your appropriate NetID):</p>
<pre><code>echo &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/config &lt;&lt;EOF
Host cs50
   Hostname plink.thayer.dartmouth.edu
   User f12345x
EOF
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Every time you login, it reminds you about whether you are getting close to consuming all your disk-space quota:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt; You are currently using 47.39M of your 5.00G home directory quota. &gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That's nice, but it is slow.
You can turn off this message by creating a file in your home directory <em><strong>on plink</strong></em>.
Although the mere presence of this file is sufficient, put some text in the file so you can remember why it is there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo The presence of this file disables login notification of your disk-quota usage. &gt;  ~/.notfsquota
</code></pre>
<p>If you later wish to check your disk usage, you can remove this file (then logout and login), or simply run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">tfsquota
</code></pre>
<p>There is also a simple <a href="https://quota-lookup.thayer.dartmouth.edu/">web portal</a> to check your quotas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Unix</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> is a flavor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> operating system.
It is likely the most common OS in use today, and the one we use on all CS and Thayer systems.</p>
<p>Definitive documentation for the Unix tools we use can be found in 'man pages' (short for &quot;manual pages&quot;) on <code>plink.thayer.dartmouth.edu</code>.
For example, to learn the details of the <code>ls</code> command, type <code>man ls</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're welcome to employ your favorite search engine, but beware that there are subtle variations in UNIX tools across its many flavors and distributions.
What you find online may not work on <code>plink</code> Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a deeper dive, there are many books on UNIX and all of its variants, including Linux (see below).</p>

<h2>Bash</h2>
<p>When you log into <code>plink</code> over ssh, you are running the <code>bash</code> shell.
You will need to learn basic <code>bash</code> commands for getting around, and for writing scripts.
Here are some good references for bash and bash scripting.</p>

<h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
<p>In CS50 we use the <code>git</code>  distributed version control system, with repositories hosted on GitHub, for managing and sharing your source code.
Specifically, we use <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> to manage your development process, submit your labs for grading, and share code with your project team.</p>
<p><strong><a href="github.md">Set yourself up</a> on GitHub</strong>.</p>
<p>For help with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, look for the Help item under the top-right menu on any GitHub page, which leads to the extensive <a href="https://docs.github.com/en">help site</a>.</p>
<p>Try  <em><a href="https://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/">Visualizing Git Concepts with D3</a></em> to experiment with git concepts.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong>
git and GitHub recently changed the default name of the primary branch in new repositories; the conventional default name was <code>master</code>, and now it is <code>main</code>.
Throughout CS50 we use <code>main</code> as the initial, primary branch within our repositories.
However, there are still many online examples, tutorials, and tools that assume <code>master</code> is the name of the primary branch.
The functionality has not changed, only the name, so many of the techniques form those examples and tutorials will apply if you adapt them to this name change.</p>
<h2>'screen' Terminal multiplexer</h2>
<p>When you open a Terminal window and ssh to <code>plink</code>, you get one window, one shell.
Sometimes you want (or need) multiple windows, and sometimes your connection breaks and you lose everything you were doing.
The program called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> can help!
With <code>screen</code> you can have multiple terminal sessions running on <code>plink</code> and if you have to disconnect for some reason (e.g., to eat or sleep) when you return those <code>screen </code> sessions will be right where you left them.
This is <em>really</em> handy for man pages, debugging, and more, especially when working remotely!</p>
<p>Thayer Computing Services supports <code>screen</code>: read more about it <a href="https://kb.thayer.dartmouth.edu/article/361-linux-services">here</a>, under the heading for <em>Long-running processes</em>; ignore all the aspects about <code>krenew</code>.
Here's another <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/">tutorial</a> about screen; ignore the installation instructions, because it's already installed on plink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One catch: if you are an emacs user, screen's use of CTRL-a as a command prefix (e.g., to detach the screen) can be irritating... because emacs uses CTRL-a to move cursor to beginning of line.
It may be possible to configure <code>screen</code> to bind a different character as a command prefix.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>'tmux' Terminal multiplexer</h2>
<p>Another popular terminal multiplexer is called <code>tmux</code>; some prefer it over <code>screen</code>.
Ham Vocke describes it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within one terminal window you can open multiple windows and split-views (called “panes” in tmux lingo).
Each pane will contain its own, independently running terminal instance.
This allows you to have multiple terminal commands and applications running visually next to each other without the need to open multiple terminal emulator windows.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><a href="https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/">A guide to customizing your tmux conf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hamvocke/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux/.tmux.conf">Nice set of configuration changes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tmuxguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tmux/tmux.html">All the tmux commands (CTRL-b + …)</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One catch: if you are an emacs user, tmux's use of CTRL-b as a command prefix can be very irritating... because emacs uses CTRL-b for backspace.
You can rebind tmux's command prefix to a different character, but choose wisely.
This <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1287428/cant-rebind-ctrl-b-to-ctrl-a-in-tmux">online thread</a> hints at the needed config change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Editors</h2>
<p>You will need to choose an editor for CS50, but we allow for personal choice.</p>
<p>We recommend <code>vim</code> or <code>emacs</code>, which are nearly always available on Unix systems.
The only editors that reliably work remotely over an <code>ssh</code> connection to a remote computer are <code>vim</code> (or <code>vi</code>) and <code>emacs</code>.
Other tools provide the illusion of editing server-housed files on your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Vim</strong>: <code>vim</code> is nothing fancy; it just works.
It is a &quot;modal&quot; editor (derived from <code>vi</code>) with many single-character commands that, when mastered, allow you to edit very quickly.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Emacs</strong>: <code>emacs</code> is powerful, extensible, and customizable.
Once you master the basic keystrokes, you can edit very quickly -- and even recompile your program from inside emacs.
See the <a href="http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html">emacs tutorial</a>

<p>There are some free full-screen editors you can download on your laptop:</p>
<p><strong>Atom</strong>: <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>  has great full-screen functionality, runs everywhere, and has a large collection of extensions.</p>
<p><strong>Sublime</strong>: the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text editor</a> can be used for free (as long as you don't mind declining the periodic requests to pay).
It is also highly extensible using Python &amp; JSON.
See this great <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course--net-27293">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>VScode</strong>: Microsoft's <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> is another great full-screen editor, runs everywhere, and also has a large collection of extensions.
See <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics">Getting started with Visual Studio Code</a>.
But, <strong>important warning:</strong>
change the default location of the vscode database to reside on the local disk instead of your home directory.
To do this, go into <code>Settings&gt;Remote&gt;Extensions&gt;C/C++</code> and change the value of <code>C_Cpp.default.browse.databaseFilename</code> to:
<code>/tmp/vscode-${USER}/${workspaceFolderBasename}/browse.vc.db</code>
You can also do this manually by sshing to any Thayer system and creating/editing <code>~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/setting.json</code> to add this parameter:</p>
<p>&quot;C_Cpp.default.browse.databaseFilename&quot;: &quot;/tmp/vscode-${USER}/${workspaceFolderBasename}/browse.vc.db&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: from the nice Thayer Computing folks:
&quot;The problem appears to be with the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense">IntelliSense</a> database that the C/C++ Extension uses. When this is first run, it trolls all system libraries and caches all the symbols it finds. This, although it is resource-intensive, is a one-time-per-launch activity and happens reasonably quickly. However, the extension then seems to read and write the database it creates constantly. Since this is, by default, located in a user's nfs home directory, it creates thousands of small reads and writes per second, resulting in a backup of system calls and increase in load average. If enough users use this, it will overwhelm the system and cause a denial of service.&quot;</p>

<h3><a id="set-editor">Setting your favorite EDITOR</a></h3>
<p>Once you have settled on a preferred editor, you should make that information available to apps that might open an editor for you.
(One common example: <code>git commit</code> opens an editor for you to review a list of files to commit, and to type a commit message.)
Even if you normally use a remote editor (like vscode) you should choose an editor (vim or emacs) for occasions when you need to make edits directly on plink.</p>
<p>The most universal method is to define the <code>EDITOR</code> shell variable.
We placed some examples in the file <code>~/cs50-dev/dotfiles/profile.cs50</code>, but you need to uncomment one of the lines to select the editor you prefer.
Changes to this file take effect the next time you login; to effect them immediately, you can <code>source ~/cs50-dev/dotfiles/profile.cs50</code>.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can set a preferred editor specifically for git; for example, <code>git config --global core.editor emacs</code> (or vim).
If set, git will ignore <code>EDITOR</code> and use this setting.
We recommend the universal approach because many applications check <code>$EDITOR</code>, not just git.</p>
<h2>Whiteboarding</h2>
<p>For some team activities, particularly the final project, it may be helpful to create a shared 'whiteboard' where you can draw diagrams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom has a built-in whiteboard feature, but remember to screen-capture the board before the breakout rooms close!</li>
<li><a href="https://jamboard.google.com">Google Jamboard</a> allows you to create (and save) shared whiteboard drawings.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have other suggestions, let the Professor know so this list can grow.</p>
<h2>Markdown</h2>
<p>We use Markdown in CS50 for all documentation; it is also the standard for all documentation in GitHub.</p>
<p>A file with extension <code>.md</code> is assumed to be a text file in 'Markdown' syntax, which provides very simple (and readable) markup for headings, lists, italics, bold, hyperlinks, code snippets, and embedded images.
(This course website is written in Markdown and rendered with Jekyll.) Many source-code web portals (like GitHub) allow you to browse the files in your repository - automatically rendering any that are in Markdown format, making such files much nicer to look at than plain-text files.
You can edit Markdown files in any text editor, but there are some specialized editors available.
Many CS50 students/groups have found <a href="https://hackmd.io">HackMD</a> to be very useful.
Markdown is easy to learn and there are many useful resources online.
<em>Keep in mind, however, that Markdown syntax is not standardized, so each tool may render Markdown slightly differently; in CS50 we standardize on GitHub's flavor of Markdown.</em></p>

<h2>valgrind</h2>
<p><a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> is a family of tools for dynamic analysis of programs; in CS50 we use it to watch for memory leaks and related errors.
See also the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1174/guide_valgrind.html">quick guide to valgrind</a>.</p>
<h2>gdb</h2>
<p>We recommend and support the use of <code>gdb</code> in CS50, and you may be expected to use it in later CS courses.
For details, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/">the GDB manual</a>
and this excellent <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/gdb-refcard.pdf">quick reference card</a>.</p>
<h2>make</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> is a utility for determining what needs to be done (e.g., compile, link, copy, etc.) to build a program or other target, and then issues the commands to do it.</p>
<h2>X windows</h2>
<p>We do not require or support X11 in CS50.
If you want to run window-based (or graphical) applications on the Linux servers, but allow them to pop open windows on your Mac or Windows laptop, we recommend <a href="https://kb.thayer.dartmouth.edu/article/435-fastx">FastX</a>.</p>
