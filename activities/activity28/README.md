# Activity: Bitwise Operations

Copy the file `bitwise.c` from our examples directory into your home directory on plink. Fill in the function stubs. In each case, return the modified version of the parameter `num`.

Write at least 3 tests for each function in `main`, and include a comment about the expected return value for each. For example:

```
// Test cases
int main() {
    printf("%d\n", isBitSet(5, 2));  // Should return 1

    // Lots more tests

    return 0;
}
```
> [!TIP]
> You can print numbers in binary using the `%032b` format. You might get a compiler warning; just ignore it.

Turn in your completed `bitwise.c` to Canvas for this activity.
