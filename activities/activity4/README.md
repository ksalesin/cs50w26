# Activity: C ya !

**Working in your group (perhaps one person sharing screen)**, answer the following. Add your group answers to a markdown file (`activity4.md`) and upload it to Canvas for this activity.

To include source code in a markdown file, put it inside a code block which begins and ends with three back-tics (the character just left of the "1" key):

````
```
main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```
````

Do these exercises on plink, and copy your answers back to your machine to upload to Canvas.

## 1. Add the missing code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int width = 24, length = 11;
  
    // Print out the area of the box defined by width and length
    // It should look like:
    //     A box of width ## and length ## has an area of ##.
  
    // Calculate the length of the diagonal (hint: think Pythagoras)
    // and print it with two decimal places
    // It should look like:
    //     A box of width ## and length ## has a diagonal of ##.##.
  
}
```

## 2. Fix it

```c
void main()
{
    int a;
 
    if (a == 2)
        a++;
        printf("value of a is", a);
 
    else printf("value of a is not equal to 2 ");
}
```

## 3. Even or odd

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int temp = 0, odd = 0;
    char answer[5];
  
    if (argc == 2) {
        if (sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &temp) == 1) {
            // Determine whether the # is even or odd with one operator
            // If it's odd, set `odd` to 1 

            // ??? //
            
            if (odd) {
              strncpy(answer, "Odd", sizeof(answer));
            } else {
              strncpy(answer, "Even", sizeof(answer));
            }
            puts(answer);
            return(0);
        }
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr,"Usage: %s num , where num is an integer\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
}
```



## 4. Produce the sum of integers 

Finish the program below to sum the positive integers from 1 to the provided integer number.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int sum = 0, max = 0;
    if (argc == 2) {
        if (sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &max) == 1) {
            // make sure the max is valid
          
            // use a loop to calculate the sum
      
            // display the answer
        } else {
            // user entered a non-number, so issue an error message and exit
        }
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr,"Usage: %s num , where num is an integer\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
}
```



## 5. Leap year

Write a complete C program (possibly reusing some of the above code) to determine whether a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if:

- It is a multiple of 4 but not of 100, or
- It is a multiple of 400.



## 6. How big is it

Write a complete C program to print the size in bytes of  these C datatypes:  char, int, short, long, float, and double.

**Extra** Copy your program back to your machine, build, and run it. Are the 
results the same? If not, why do you think they are different?

## 7. Print a half-pyramid

A half pyramid pattern of numbers looks like a right-triangle of numbers in which the hypotenuse is on the right-hand side. Write a program to accept an integer and print a half-pyramid.

***Example*** 

```
$ ./c7 5
1 
2 2 
3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 5 
$ 
```

**Don't forget: one team member should upload your answers to Activity 4 on Canvas.**
