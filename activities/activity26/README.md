# Activity: Build a Simple Log File Analyzer

Copy the `file_io` directory from our examples on plink into your home directory.

It provides a partially complete module that reads and analyzes a log file; complete the missing functions in `file_utils.c` to make it work.

## Scenario

A server generates log files with entries like:
```
2024-01-15 08:30:45 INFO User login: alice
2024-01-15 08:31:02 ERROR Connection timeout: 10.0.0.5
2024-01-15 08:31:15 INFO User login: bob
2024-01-15 08:32:00 WARNING Disk usage: 85%
```

Complete the `file_utils.c` program so that it:
1. Reads the log file
2. Counts entries by severity (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
3. Writes a summary report
4. Extracts and saves all ERROR entries to a separate file

There are five routines to complete. A sixth one is not used by default in the program, but is there if you have some extra time.
To test the sixth routine, define EXTRA.

**Hints**:
* You may find our [unit about files](https://www.spongium.org/unit/c-stdio) a helpful reference.
* You may want to read through the `log_analyzer.c` file for some code inspiration.

## Testing

The application can be tested by running `make test`. You can use `diff` to compare your output to the ones in the directory `expected_output`.

## Completion
Your group should turn in `file_utils.c` to Canvas.
